> The following is a continuation of a shorter [instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/DKIsC9XyDmGaNFDMUPsb_lrr9u7D0MEd4zCNrQ0/?img_index=1) on my climbing account.

Where do we go between posts? It's as if the fabric of time expands between these bookends, and wringing it out for a few drops of reflection almost feels like a desperate act. Almost like storing a snapshot of yourself, out of fear that it might escape and float off into the abyss. Maybe one day, like in a video game, we will be able to restart from these checkpoints, and all the work will have paid off. But for now, they remain inert histories, books written and shelved that ostensibly offer a sense of closure to the past however long.

Although it's the western standard for thought, I don't think anyone experiences time linearly. It does not march along a linear axis, but instead constricts, seizes, "starts and stops, bubbles up, collects in the cracks, and folds into mountains" (Saving Time xiii, xvii). The urge to pinpoint a moment is a very human desire, albeit a very hard thing to do when time is so malleable (xii). To complicate the matters, I think we create our timescales. To continue this instagram analogy, where we post and set the bookends are arbitrary, but nonetheless build our personal view of time. We constrict our experiences at specific points that we think are emblematic of an overall trend, or represent an ending or beginning. Demarcations we make are not descriptive, they in fact **become** our reality. Time does not just happen to us, we co-create our sense of time (xix).

Posting offers some sense of fixedness, like you're rendering a past experience into some semblance of a book chapter with lessons learned and a clear path forward. It is a cute feeling, but misleading. My skepticism is best summarized by the title of this mindfulness book, "Wherever You Go, There You Are." For me, the title suggests that you bring the same person with you everywhere, regardless of your temporal reality. That although you may experience personal chapters, your history is now. It is not behind you, there is no behind you, what you perceive as past is contained in who you are now.

Time is all over the place, and I think that it is really hard to make posting feel authentic for this reason. Sometimes I don't want the content I make to be digestible and bite sized. Chewing a little bit longer and eating a little bit less is preferred. Hunger makes a good seasoning.

- [Saving Time](https://cdn.penguin.co.uk/dam-assets/books/9781847926845/9781847926845-sample.pdf) by Jenny Odell. The introduction is provided for free at this link. I highly recommend giving it a quick read. Among other ideas, she discusses the human desire to pinpoint a moment, experiencing time in a non-linear way, and problematic productivity culture language about time. Especially interesting is her nod to the nausea produced by constantly toggling between different timescales (her example is a Slack window vs climate change headlines).
- The demarcations being function and not descriptive is a postmodernism thing. Read Foucault (or better yet, just have someone explain it to you).
- *Wherever You Go, There You Are* by Jon Kabat-Zinn. Haven't read it by my mom said it was good. If you're interested in mindfulness this could be a good one to pick up.
- [For America to Live Europe Must Die](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/russell-means-for-america-to-live-europe-must-die) by Russell Means. Maybe my favorite speech ever. The significance to this piece is his detestation of writing, that it gets a legitimacy denied to other forms of thinking. I think this relates to status quo social media, which crowds out other forms of reflection and thinking. 
- I think what I post are moreso "spots of time.” This is concept from a William Wordsworth poem. It refers to intense moments of emotional significance (specifically in nature) that last in memory and give you strength.

> [!quote] William Wordsworth, The Prelude. Book 12. 208-218 (1850 edition)
There are in our existence spots of time,
That with distinct pre-eminence retain
A renovating virtue, whence, depressed
By false opinion and contentious thought,
Or aught of heavier or more deadly weight,
In trivial occupations, and the round
Of ordinary intercourse, our minds
Are nourished and invisibly repaired;
A virtue, by which pleasure is enhanced,
That penetrates, enables us to mount,
When high, more high, and lifts us up when fallen
