At moments, suffering seems to exist in the hallway between where you have been and where you are headed. This kind of suffering is more easy on the conscious. The mind happily dismantles it. But other moments you don't know the window it arrived from or if there's an exit around the corner. When something is broken, and the fragments seem out of reach. Here the mind's coup is destined to fail.

It’s unlikely that the pieces  will all appear, but there is something in the search. Learning the jigsaw while surrendering to the cracks, to the new ways the shards will fit. 

Between where you are and where you travel there is suffering, but there is also
An attempt to appreciate
A glancing up to see a friend
Roses in the garden
Waking up in the middle of the day
The sense that you are once
And once is all

We are once
and once is all

It all leads to gratitude

We all deserve much more love than we think

Love yourself, forget it, love the world
