CNAR (Climbing numerical assessment of radness) is a translation of GNAR (Gaffney's numerical assessment of radness) for climbing. Climbing conveniently already has an effective numeric ranking system, making it much easier, however I have converted all bonus points to be climbing-specific. Currently adapted for boulderers, but you can use your imagination to extrapolate it. To make sure that extra credit points apply to all levels, I use terms like "easy", "hard", "limit," or "project" in place of V-grades. Enjoy!

%%
- Implement the Scaling factor for V-grades as an alternative (maybe not necessary)
	- or try to use terms like "midgrade" so that you can base it on your skill factor
- line related ECPs?
- if you catch a penalty on film you recover half of that penalty's deduction
	- something to tie into making an edit at the end of the game?
- The point of if being to egotistical is to take ego out of the equation by making it funny
- What behavior do we want to encourage?

# The Game
### Requirements
Mental Age: 1 to 65 years old
IQ: 60 to 100
Number of Players: 2 to $\infty$
### Object
Score as many points as possible to acquire the highest "CNAR Factor."
### To Play
1) Players decide on a group of competitors
2) Choose a time limit (day, week, month)
3) Choose a crag or area
4) The player with the highest "CNAR factor" wins!
#### Scoring
Players may score points in the following ways:
1) Attempting boulder problems for their V-points
2) Acquiring extra credit points

At the end of the designated time limit of game play, players shall total all their V-points plus their extra credit points and penalties to determine their CNAR Factor.
$$\text{CNAR Factor = Problem Scores + Extra Credit Points - Penalties}$$
### To Win
The winner is the player with the highest CNAR factor at the end of the designated playing time.

### Rules
1) Cheating is not allowed
2) Players must score themselves unless you want to find a non-player to score keep for you
3) Problems can only be scored once per day
4) You must score yourself if you try a problem. Scoring only the problems that you want to score but attempting many is not allowed. When trying a problem, it must be scored, even if you don't send.
5) Extra credit points fall into three categories: daily, trip(ly), and unlimited. Daily ECPs can be scored once per day, trip(ly) ECPs can be scored once per trip, and unlimited ECPs can be scored as many times as possible in one day.
6) Penalties must be accounted for. It is up to you and your competitors to be honest about scoring your penalties. Penalties cannot be used up. You can rack up an unlimited number of penalties.
7) Multiple ECPs and Penalties can be scored on any problem by simply performing any combination of them.

Summary Scenario:
*You flash center direct V10 and top it out, with a mid climb butt scratch, ego claim after, and get a split*
CNAR points: 14
- 10 points for the grade of V10
- 3 points for a flash
- 2 points for a butt scratch
- 2 points for an ego claim
- 2 points for it being a highball
- -5 points for a split
