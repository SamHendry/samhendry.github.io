Hi! This is the personal website of Samuel Hendry Eaton. I'll be posting some of my thoughts here and uploading work I'm proud of.

 If you are moved by a piece, let me know. My intent is not to talk to a void. Much of this will not be scientific (I make little attempt to separate knowledge from experience), and I may not agree with what I've written in the past, but I hope you can find something of interests and stumble into a good conversation. A professor I met on a boat mused that his job title ought to be "provocateur"; I see this site in a similar manner.

> In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts: they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty. Great works of art have no more affecting lesson for us than this. They teach us to abide by our spontaneous impression with good-humored inflexibility then most when the whole cry of voices is on the other side. Else, to-morrow a stranger will say with masterly good sense precisely what we have thought and felt all the time, and we shall be forced to take with shame our own opinion from another.
