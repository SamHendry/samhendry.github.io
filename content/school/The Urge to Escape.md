When I read Brave New World by Aldous Huxley, the character that I feel the most allegiance to was the “Savage,” a transplant from a faraway culture living in a society not of his own design. Society in this dystopian vision reality is highly engineered, with prescribed consumerism, mandated hedonism, and the ruling order focus on meeting the impulses and desires of everyone, using comfort and complacency as a means of control. Unable to withstand the state of society, the savage attempts to escape, removing himself to a lighthouse where he hopes to live out the remainder of his life in a way that he can control. However, when he succumbs to the pressure of society and performs an act of hedonism, he realizes he cannot escape and commits suicide. Preceding his escape attempt, the savage remarked, “I ate civilization … It poisoned me; I was defiled. And then I ate my own wickedness” (241).

The savage’s experience in BNW is an extreme example of the conflicts that arise from living in a society not of your own design, and the allure of escape to one you can. This feeling is best embodied by the 1960s Commune Movements, who reacted to a changing world they were dissatisfied with, and chose to withdraw to reclaim freedom to build their own world. It is perhaps best described by Robert Hourier, a journalist who visited fifty communes between 1968 and 1970. He called it “the gut reaction of a generation” (xii), speaking to the communard’s reaction to the misaligned status quo. There was an incredibly unpopular Vietnam war, the civil rights movement was brewing, and politics relating to rights and “moral passion” were increasingly visible with TV as the newly dominant form of home entertainment. Counterculture was disgusted at the direction of American culture and worship of the dollar, and psychedelics were widely available (Miller 6, 67). To add to the dizziness, “Successful adulthood was pictured as a two car garage house in a white suburb. To young people, this looked like a sham, and they were ready to quit” (Odell, 38).

# Conditions for Communalism

## Counterculture

Piven and Cloward outline that in order for a protest movement to emerge, there must be a transformation of both consciousness and behavior (3). First, the system loses legitimacy in the eyes of its subjects (3-4). Second, people who are ordinarily complacent with the structure of society begin to assert “rights.” Third, people believe they have the ability to achieve these rights (4). Once the collective consciousness changes, a transformation of behavior can occur. In other words, the people become defiant and act out this defiance together, either through recognized protest methods or other group actions (4). The rise of counterculture, rooted in earlier bohemian movements like the beat generation, was itself a transformation of consciousness, and the communes were simply an embodiment of the unconventional values it inspired.

### Tearing at the Establishment

The transformation of consciousness that inspired the 60s communes was not a discrete event, but rather a cultural revolution, a slew of overlapping events and developments that inspired perspectives liberated from the shackles of the status quo. First and foremost, counterculture was on the rise, specifically a critical view of US culture popularized by beat generation writers. The beat generation was a literary subculture movement that rejected materialism and mainstream American life, opting instead for a more spiritual journey through life, and exploring less conservative topics like substance experimentation and sexual liberation (Miller, 3-5). New magazines like the Realist and Mad magazine unleashed social criticisms and questioned authority in front of the masses (4-5), and comedians like Lenny Bruce tried a new type of vulgar and critical comedy aimed at public figures (he later was convicted of obscenity). This new media de-legitimized mainstream American society to its readers, poking holes in the predominant social arrangements.

### Moral Indignation

Ordinarily, protest movements are very infrequent, due partly to a cultural belief in meritocracy—that success is due to some talent or industriousness, while the worse off are that way because they deserve it (Piven & Cloward, 6). However, as I mentioned above, during the 1960s, politics of rights and “moral passion” were extremely visible to the average American through TV. The various protest movements they saw on the screen showed them what it looked like to demand “rights” and the direct action associated with making them a reality. Although the intentions and implementation of communes varied drastically from one to another, “What the comunes did have in common was a search for the ‘good life,’ an experience of community opposed to the competitive and exploitative system they had rejected” (Odell, 40). The foundation of the communards’ vision was that they had the right to drop out of a society that did not work for them, even though many of them had no idea what they were doing aside from the notion that they were dropping out (39).

### Zeitgeist: Spirit of the Time

Lastly, people began to see that dropout life was increasingly feasible. Psychedelics, which were still legal and widely available in the 60s, had a powerful effect on social life and generally helped people lose their inhibitions. One of the earliest 1960s era communes were the Merry Pranksters, who lived communally at the house of Ken Kesey, the author they followed, and were known for their 1964 summer “road trip” in a tie dye painted bus, where their chief concern was organizing parties and giving out LSD (Miller, 17-20). Other early communes (between 1960 and 1965) included the derelict open land on Gorda Mountain, which became known for drug trading and served as a crash pad for people driving from Los Angeles to San Francisco (20), and Drop City, a foundational 60s commune which embodied anarchy, pacifism, sexual freedom, interest in drugs, and art at a flamboyant level not seen yet. It was a complete rejection of mainstream culture and a declaration of a new civilization, rejecting paid employment, giving its members new names, and using trash as material (31-33).

#### Word Spreads

At a certain point, mainstream media got on the beat, and the sensationalization of communes created a positive feedback loop. The creation of communes was accelerated through media publicity, from the underground press to mass media sensationalization of nudity and drug use, to communes producing books and community media of their own (15). Communes became self-replicating as the media caused more people to see commune-building as an attractive and exciting alternative to mainstream society. Additionally, many pre-60s communes interacted with and inspired the new communes (8).

#### Fortune and Generosity

The feasibility of communes in the 60s was enabled by the newly expanded government welfare programs and its “war on poverty” that made living without a job possible. Many communes such as Drop City relied on welfare food stamps, as well as donated produce (34-35). Post WWII prosperity also made nonproductive youth wealthier (5), and in many cases the initial land that the communes were built on came from the wealth of one of the commune members. Twin Oaks was initially financed by a man with an inheritance that he wanted to make socially productive (57), and Millbrook started on land from the grandchildren of the founder of Gulf Oil (27).

# The Organization and Embodiment of Critique

To give a cohesive account of the objectives of the communes would be impossible because the communes themselves were nowhere near cohesive. In the introduction of Timothy Miller’s book, he writes that “The communes of the 1960s era were so diverse that nearly any attempt to generalize them is preordained to fail” (xxiv). The only thing that most had in common was their demographics, which were predominantly young, white, and middle class, and tended to have communitarianism in their backgrounds (10), although there were obvious exceptions like the Panther Party houses. 

## Individual Inspirations

Some communes were organized out of convenience, as members not only found living communally easier financially, but also found it satisfied what American culture lacked: community, engagement, and dependence (67). Some communes were organized according to grand utopian visions, like Twin Oaks which was inspired by psychologist B. F. Skinner’s book Walden Two (56-59), while others like Morning Star focused on nudity, psychedelics, sex, practicing yoga, and reading works from eastern spiritual masters (49).

The organization of individual communes was also dependent on their individual fortune, and internal organization was expected to emerge organically through the flow of inspiration (155). As more of an emotional flight than a calculated action, these communes depended on the members’ individual gut reactions to society. Even within communes there were fluctuating people and ideologies, partially because most did not define admission procedures, so it was difficult to distinguish between members and visitors (Wallmeier 156). This individualistic nature led communes to be ideologically heterogeneous, unstable, and economically disorganized.

## Escapism or Critique?

The individual nature brings into question whether the dramatic surge of communes in the 1960s should be considered escapism, or more of a social movement and critique of society. In Exit as Critique, Philip Wallmeier details that social movement studies are the dominant frame for defining critique, and the field is mostly fixated on collective, public speech acts directed at authorities (150). Through this lens, the communal experiments of the 1960s appear to be more of a silent escape than a social movement. “While critique is usually associated with collective action, publicness, and speech, withdrawal, on the contrary, is understood as an individual action, as a private and mute gesture” (148). However, Wallermeier holds that the act of screaming out in indignation and leaving society is itself a critique, even if the communes mostly refused to give their feelings a specific name (157). These acts of refusal should still be considered a form of critique worthy of attention, especially considering that the 60s communes were essentially a mass revolt against traditional American values.

## Tactical Withdrawal

These communes do not utilize tactics directed at authority generally recognized by social movement literature but instead employ a pseudo-anarchist tactic. Whereas anarchist movements seek to build a new society in the shell of the old, communes seek to build a new social order in the void left by withdrawal from the old. Communards remove themselves because they feel they can not get the change that they want through “pluralist” politics, so they embody the change they want in a commune as a direct action (154-155). It was a silent but nonetheless mass cry of individuals against conventional political participation and the nuclear family, out of personal pain as well as a vision of a better society (156). Even before the 60s era communal tsunami, “Yearning for personal growth and fulfillment rather than for conventional social achievement that characterizes the 1960s outlooks reflects a central force in many historic American Communes” (Miller 7).

# Starting from Scratch

The heart of the struggle that communes faced internally is best summed up in this line from Jenny Odell, “A spatial move to the country, or into an isolated communal house, did not always equal a move out of ingrained ideologies” (41). Especially since the communes were primarily white middle class people fleeing capitalist suburbs, the communards often struggled to imagine new communal politics free of all the problems they were trying to escape. In fact, Odell observes that when working with a “blank slate,” people (maybe more so from this demographic) trend toward technocratic solutions (38). This means that they attempt to replace politics with design, to build and engineer a new community where everyone is content and satisfied, such that the plurality of the individual communards need not be discussed. To me, this sounds like Brave New World all over again, but this time under the pretense of communalism. “Politics necessarily exist between even two individuals with free will; any attempt to reduce politics to design … is also an attempt to reduce people to machines or mechanical beings” (52). In fact, in the same book that the commune Twin Oaks was modeled after, Walden Two, Skinner struggled with plurality, evidenced by the fact that he decided to take out the chapter on race.

## Generalizing Struggle

Another problem that the communes faced was generalizing the struggles and experiences that caused them to drop out. They were successful at physical disengagement, which Wallmeier defines as the first level of critique, or the initial scream of indignation, but struggled to achieve the second level of critique, or generalizing emotions and connecting their experience to shared orders of worth (152). When the communes attempted to generalize their feelings of indignation, through community media and underground journalism, their critique of society was deepened (159). The second level of critique means moving past the initial bodily reaction and generalizing the emotions to connect them to larger struggles and ideas of right and wrong. Due to the vastly individual nature of the communes and feelings of their individual members, this kind of generalization was hard to make. Because of this, 60s communes can be better understood as acts of inspired but disorganized indignation, but were nonetheless a radical critique of mainstream American values (160).

# Moving Forward

Along with the 60s communes that are still surviving today, this wave of communalism had a large impact on hip culture. In fact, “the urban hippies did not create the first 1960s-era communes; it would be closer to the truth to say that the earliest communes helped create the hippies” (2). They were experimentation grounds that allowed almost unlimited freedom in the midst of a cultural revolution, and gave us insight into alternative social arrangements that we would not have otherwise had.

In the foreword to a 1946 new edition of Island, Huxley wrote:

>[!quote] “If I were now to rewrite the book, I would offer the Savage a third alternative. Between the Utopian and primitive horns of his dilemma would lie the possibility of sanity ... In this community economics would be decentralist and Henry-Georgian, politics Kropotkinesque and co-operative.

Sounds like a commune, right?
