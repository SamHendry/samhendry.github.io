And just like that, the saga ends. The main character: Silent Observer, a proud line up the steepest section of the Icebox boulder in Rattlesnake Canyon. It spends its decades enjoying a great view of the Santa Barbara ocean, watching the world unfold before its steady gaze. A guest appearance: me, an fellow resident to the area living just five minutes away. The episode lasted only a year, a fraction of the boulder's time, but marked a significant section of my life. 

The first couple sessions during the month of January showed me an ascent was possible, but what what followed I could not have predicted. Twice I found on the ground after a foot pick on the last move (which has got to be v2). It was frustrating. Not only had I got all the information that I needed to know I can climb the grade, but I came temptingly close to success, twice. Long gaps punctuated my sessions while I studied in college and each time I returned the same problems remained. Maybe it was a bit too warm. Maybe my skin was bad. Maybe I was tired from travel. The factors necessary seemed to be ships in the night.

But on the fated day, January 14th 2026, a year after the story began in January 2025, and three years since I started climbing in January 2023, perhaps something was different. Maybe my skin was drier than normal. Maybe I got lucky and hit the crimp just right. Maybe I simply am a better climber now (fingers crossed). I'd like to think it is because I finally found myself surrendered to the process. That you ever reach a point where you *should* do a boulder is something I've become skeptical of, it feels better to see climbing as one long moment. All I can do is pay attention to its moods and chronicle the interesting bits.
